## About
This project is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **pnpm**. The app uses React Router for navigation and React Query for data fetching and state management.

Whilst I have lots of experience working with Webpack in the past (and Rollup for component libraries), [Vite is increasingly edging towards being dominant over webpack]([url](https://kinsta.com/blog/vite-vs-webpack/#2-popularity-community-and-ecosystem)https://kinsta.com/blog/vite-vs-webpack/#2-popularity-community-and-ecosystem) and is the [clear winner in terms of building speed](https://kinsta.com/blog/vite-vs-webpack/#5-build-time-and-bundle-size). It also has a lot less overhead, which is why I decided to use it in this project. 

## Setup
+ clone repo
+ setup .env file with api key as VITE_CAT_API_KEY='yourApiKey'
+ run **pnpn i** to install dependencies
+ run **pnpn dev** to start

This project also has storybook, to start run **pnpn storybook**

## Key Features
+ **React Router Integration:** React Router for handling navigation.
+ **Data Fetching with React Query:** Uses React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and updating the UI based on the data state (loading, error, success).
+ **Lazy Loading of Components:** Implemented Reacts lazy loading feature to enhance performance by loading pages only when needed.
+ **Custom Hooks for Data Management:** I've wrote custom hooks to encapsulate the logic for data fetching and management.
+ **TypeScript Support:** TypeScript for type safety.
+ **Styling and Layout:** Uses CSS modules for component styling, ensures styles are scoped and maintainable.

## External Packages Used
  + react-dropzone
  + react-icons
  + react-query
  + react-router-dom
  + axios
  + storybook
  + husky
  + eslint
  + lint-staged
  + prettier

## Code Quality Safeguard
For code quality and styling this project has pre-commit hooks setup to automatically check code as it is commited. If there are errors then it is rejected. This is achieved using the following packages:
+ husky
+ elint
+ prettier
+ lint-staged

The commits are automatically formatted as well using prettier to ensure consistency. Here's an example of some broken code and what it looks like:

and when we try and commit:

## Storybook

I am a big advocate for maintainability, and keeping components clean and resuable. I've added storybook to this project to demonstrate this:

As you can see, storybook allows us to visually inspect/test all the props of the Card component in complete isolation from the rest of the application, allowing me to live update props.

## Testing
I have provided tests for the CatCard component using jest and react-testing-library. 

## Performance Considerations
Obviously performance is important, and ensuring the project is optimised can lead to significant differences in performance. In this project I have used memoisation where necessary to avoid duplicate re-renders. I have also added code splitting/lazy loading for the different routes, so this will have an impact on performance as not everything is loaded as one big chunk:

## Things to consider for further improvement:
+ Make use of react-query optimisitic updates and global state to decrease api calls
+ Pagination/virtualisation - At the moment we cap how much data is returned, however it would be good to implement a proper approach.
